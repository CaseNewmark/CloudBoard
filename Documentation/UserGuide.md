## Tips and Tricks

- **Organizing Nodes**: Use the canvas space creatively to group related nodes
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Place more important nodes centrally or at the top
- **Connection Flow**: Consider using a consistent direction for connections to improve readability
- **Regular Saves**: While auto-save is enabled, it's good practice to manually save important changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Node not moving**: Ensure you're dragging from the node body, not a connector
- **Can't create connection**: Make sure you're dragging from and to valid connector points
- **Changes not saving**: Check your network connection or try a manual save

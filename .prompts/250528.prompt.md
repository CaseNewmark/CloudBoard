capture the delete key, show a confirmation dialog with the number of selected nodes and connections and delete them

> Copilot: I'll help you implement a delete key handler with a confirmation dialog for selected nodes and connections. Let's break this down:
> 
> 1. First, I need to find the TypeScript component file associated with the HTML template
> 2. Add code to capture the delete key press
> 3. Add a confirmation dialog
> 4. Implement the deletion functionality for selected nodes and connections
> 
> Let me start by finding the corresponding TypeScript component file: Now let's examine the TypeScript component file to understand the current structure and functionality: Let me see if there's more to the component file: Now, I need to check if there are any existing dialog components or services I can use for the confirmation dialog: Let me search for any existing dialog components in PrimeNG that I can use: Based on my searches, I can see that the project is using PrimeNG components including ConfirmDialog and the app already has a confirmation system in place in the toolbar component. I'll now implement the requested delete key functionality using a similar approach.

> First, let's look at what we need to implement:
> 1. Add a keyboard event handler to capture the delete key press

> Now let's update the deleteSelectedNode method to use our new common delete function: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Finally, let's add the ConfirmDialog component to the HTML template: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> That's it! I've implemented the requested functionality:
> 
> 1. Added a Delete key event listener to capture the delete key press
> 2. Added a confirmation dialog using PrimeNG's ConfirmDialog component
> 3. The dialog shows the number of selected nodes and connections that will be deleted
> 4. When confirmed, the selected nodes and their connections are deleted from the CloudBoard
> 
> Here's how it works:
> - When the user presses the Delete key and has nodes selected, a confirmation dialog appears
> - The dialog shows how many nodes and connections will be deleted
> - If the user confirms, the nodes and their connections are removed
> - The method also handles the cleanup of UI selection state 
> 
> I also refactored the existing deleteSelectedNode method to use the new common deletion flow for consistency.

generate a service similar to the access the INodeRepository similar to the ICloudBoardService with interface and implementation

>    - Created `NodeEndpoints.cs` with RESTful endpoints for:
>      - Creating nodes (POST)
>      - Retrieving nodes (GET)
>      - Updating nodes (PUT)
>      - Deleting nodes (DELETE)
>    - Registered endpoints in Program.cs
> 
> 4. **Service Registration**:
>    - Added NodeService and NodeRepository registrations in the dependency injection container

update the angular components to use the new api endpoints to directly store any changes in the cloudboard

> Copilot: I'll update the Angular components to use the new API endpoints for storing changes directly in the CloudBoard. Let's start by understanding the current component structure and identifying the components that need to be modified. Let's examine the flowboard component first, as it's likely the main component managing the flow interactions: Now let's examine the base-node.component, which likely contains functionality for node interactions: Let's also check the toolbar component that might have actions to save the board: Now I'll check the template for the flowboard component to see what events it handles: Now let's look at the implementation of the properties panel: Now that I've examined the key components, I'll update them to use the API endpoints for direct storage.

Let me first check the current state of the project to determine what needs to be done next. Now let me examine the specific TypeScript compile errors in the FlowboardComponent that need to be fixed: Let me try again with the correct format: Let's also check errors in the board-provider.service.ts file: Now I'll read the complete flowboard.component.ts file to understand the context better: Let's also check how the CloudBoard model is defined: Let's also check the board-provider.service.ts to understand how it's handling CloudBoard operations: Based on the error messages and code review, I can identify the TypeScript compile errors in the FlowboardComponent that need to be fixed.

replace *ngIf by modern control flow syntax @if, in the future avoid all *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwicth

> Copilot: I can see that you have a couple of `*ngIf` directives in your HTML template that need to be converted to the modern Angular control flow syntax `@if`. Let me update these for you. 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Perfect! I've updated your template to replace the `*ngIf` directives with the modern Angular control flow syntax `@if`. The changes include:
> 
> 1. **Replaced `*ngIf="isLoading"`** with `@if (isLoading) { ... }`
> 2. **Replaced `*ngIf="!isLoading"`** with `@else { ... }`
> 
> This creates a cleaner, more readable template structure using Angular's modern control flow syntax. The functionality remains exactly the same - it will show the progress spinner when loading and the "No Cloudboard loaded yet.." message when not loading.
> 
> For future reference, here are the modern control flow equivalents:
> - `*ngIf` → `@if (condition) { ... }`
> - `*ngFor` → `@for (item of items; track $index) { ... }`
> - `*ngSwitch` → `@switch (expression) { @case (value) { ... } @default { ... } }`
> 
> Your template now uses the modern syntax consistently throughout!

the api returns a 500 Internal Server Error when creating a node

> Copilot: I'll help you debug the 500 Internal Server Error when creating a node. Let me first check the API service code to understand the node creation endpoint and then examine the logs to identify the issue. Now let me examine the NodeService implementation and the repository to understand the issue: Now let me check the NodeRepository implementation: Now let me check the mapping configuration and data models to understand potential issues: Now let me check what the specific error is by looking at the mapping profile more carefully and checking the data model enum: I found the issue! The problem is in the AutoMapper configuration. Looking at the `CreateNodeDto` to `Node` mapping, there's no explicit mapping for the `Type` property. The `CreateNodeDto.Type` is a string (like "note"), but the `Node.Type` is an enum (`NodeType.Note`). AutoMapper can't automatically convert between these, so it's likely causing the 500 error.
> 
> Let me also check if there are any database schema issues by running the API and checking the logs: 

No Breakpoint in the backend code is hit, but the create node endpoint still returns a 500. I suggest to look at the NodeDto the is created on the frontend. 

> Copilot: You're right! Let me examine the NodeDto being created in the frontend and compare it with what the API expects. Looking at the `addNode` method in the FlowboardComponent, I can see the issue. I found the issue! In the frontend code, you're creating connectors like this:
> 
> ```typescript
> const inConnector = {
>   name: 'In',
>   position: 'left',
>   type: 'in'
> };
> 
> const outConnector = {
>   name: 'Out',
>   position: 'right',
>   type: 'out'
> };
> ```
> 
> But the `ConnectorDto` class requires an `Id` property that is marked as `required`. The connectors you're creating don't have IDs, which is causing the deserialization to fail and resulting in a 500 error.
> 
> Let me also check if there are any other issues with the mapping: I see another issue! The `CreateNodeDto` to `Node` mapping doesn't have explicit type conversion. The `CreateNodeDto.Type` is a string but `Node.Type` is an enum. Let me fix both issues:
> 
> 1. **Fix the frontend to not include connectors in CreateNodeDto** - connectors should be created separately
> 2. **Fix the AutoMapper configuration** to handle the type conversion 
> ```
> 
> ```
> I need to add the missing methods. Let me add them: 
> ````
> 
> ````
> Now let me fix the AutoMapper configuration to handle the type conversion properly: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> I need to add the ParseNodeType method to the mapping profile. Let me add it: 
> ````
> 
> ````
> Let me check the errors by reading the file to see what happened: Good! Now let me also check if there's another issue. Let me verify the NodeType enum values: I see the issue! The enum comments show the actual string values that should be used. Let me fix the mapping in both the frontend and backend:

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

> Copilot: Let me check the status of the application and then test if the node creation fix is working: The PowerShell doesn't support `&&` syntax. Let me use the correct PowerShell command: 

There is a conversion problem in the dtomapping. Instead of ConvertNodeTypeToString and ParseNodeType, rely on Type.toString() and Enum.Parse() just like ConnectorType does. Ensure enum strings in typesrcipt are correct and have the right case

> Copilot: You're absolutely right! Let me fix the DtoMappingProfile to use the standard `ToString()` and `Enum.Parse()` methods like the ConnectorType mapping does, and then ensure the TypeScript enum strings match the C# enum values exactly.

this html has an EOF error

> Copilot: I can see there's a syntax error in the HTML template. Looking at line 44, there's an incomplete `@case` statement:
> 
> ```html
> @case (Node') {
> ```
> 
> This should be `@case ('ImageNode')` based on the updated TypeScript enum. Let me fix this: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Now let me check if there are any other syntax errors in the file: Great! The syntax error has been fixed. The issue was that `@case (Node')` was missing the opening quote and had an incorrect enum value. I've corrected it to `@case ('ImageNode')` which matches the updated TypeScript enum.
> 
> Now the HTML template should compile correctly and the node creation should work properly with the fixed enum mappings between TypeScript and C#.
